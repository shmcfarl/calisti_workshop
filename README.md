# About This Lab

This lab has a pre-built multicluster (2 cluster) KinD setup. It has Calisti already enabled along with the demoapp running.

This lab works well in a 45 minute hands-on workshop where you spend 10 minutes on intro/slide and the rest of the time on the lab.

Tips that I give to workshop attendees:
- Show them how to copy the smm login token properly
- Show them how to setup a side-by-side browser where the Calisti UI covers the terminal window of the lab (after they have completed the UI setup). This is helpful on small monitors and allows them to do the UI work on the right while scrolling through the lab on the left.
